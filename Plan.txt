Stage2.1: 2024/11/08-2024/11/15
Plan:
1.[Locomotion][Training] do the fld task Training
1.[Locomotion][Training] train a locomotion policy that can go upstaris
1.[Locomotion][Analysis] analyse the fld locomotion policy 
2.[Navigation][Test] Test current navigation policy in diverse terrain
2.[Navigation][Training] train the navigation policy without added module to see if it is necessary
3.[Navigation][Training] train the navigation jointly with fld locomotion if (1) looks good
4.[Navigation][Analysis] Try to investigate why navigation policy with range 7-10m doesn't work
5.[Runner][Test] detailed test for ppo with human feedback for navigation task with range 4-7m
